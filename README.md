>**Abstract**: The mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based structure that
elongates to accurately segregate chromosomes during anaphase. Its position
within the cell also dictates the future cell cleavage plan, thereby determining
daughter cell orientation within a tissue or cell fate adoption for polarized
cells. Therefore, the mitotic spindle ensures at the same time proper cell
division and developmental precision. Consequently, spindle dynamics is the
matter of intensive research. Among the different cellular models that have
been explored, the one-cell stage *C. elegans* embryo has been an essential and
powerful system to dissect the molecular and biophysical basis of spindle
elongation and positioning. Indeed, in this large and transparent cell, spindle
poles (or centrosomes) can be easily detected from simple DIC microscopy by
human eyes. To perform quantitative and high-throughput analysis of spindle
motion, we developed a computer program ACT for Automated-Centrosome-Tracking
from DIC movies of C. elegans embryos. We therefore offer an alternative to the
image acquisition and processing of transgenic lines expressing fluorescent
spindle markers. Consequently, experiments on large sets of cells can be
performed with a simple setup using inexpensive microscopes. Moreover, analysis
of any mutant or wild-type backgrounds is accessible because laborious rounds of
crosses with transgenic lines become unnecessary. Last, our program allows
spindle detection in other nematode species, offering the same quality of DIC
images but for which techniques of transgenesis are not accessible.
Thus, our program also opens the way towards a quantitative evolutionary
approach of spindle dynamics. Overall, our computer program is a unique macro
for the image- and movie-processing platform ImageJ. It is user-friendly and
freely available under an open-source licence. ACT allows batch-wise analysis of
large sets of mitosis events. Within 2 minutes, a single movie is processed and
the accuracy of the automated tracking matches the precision of the human eye.

## **Requirements**

* The **ACT** macro requires `ImageJ v1.47s` or higher
([Download](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)).
* The `.mov` files require the `Quicktime plugin` for ImageJ
([Download](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/movie-opener.html))

## **Installation procedure**

By default your `ImageJ` program has no shortcut to the **ACT macro**. The
objective of this installation procedure is to transfer automatically the
**ACT macro** and all its required files within `ImageJ/Macros` sub-folder.
Finally, for convenient usage, shortcuts will be automatically generated within
the Plugins/Macros menu. If you have already a version of **ACT**, the
installation procedure will overwrite it, making easy updating of your system.

The following procedure is described in our on-line
[installation tutorial video](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LBMC/fichiers/equipe-spichty/actinstallation.mp4):

1. First launch the `ImageJ` program.
2. Open the folder you downloaded from our web site. It contains the current
version of the **ACT** macro and the `Installation.ijm` file. Drag this file and
drop it on `ImageJ` command bar (If you are currently working on `FIJI` please
use the `Installation_FIJI.ijm` file). A new window will automatically pop up.
3. Use in the menu bar the `Macros/Run Macro` command.
4. The previous window disappears and `License agreement` window of the
installation program is displayed. `Check` the license agreement box.
`Click` on `OK` to proceed with the installation.
5. The installation is then performed in few seconds. At the end of the process
the program inform you of the success of the installation.
6. Quit `ImageJ` to update the `startup macro file`  (If you perform an updating
of ACT, you can already use it without restarting ImageJ).
7. Once `ImageJ` is restarted you can see two new shortcuts in the
`Plugin/Macros` menu:

* **A.C.T.**
* **A.C.T. Command-Lines LAUNCHER**
